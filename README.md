# Atari2600
Inside the lot I bought to get my first C64 was also and Atari 2600. It was also listed as "Untested", and it was obviously salvaged from a flood considering the mud and rust that was inside the case.

In this repository are the cartridge PCBs I created or modified for my own needs (while waiting for the system to dry after a complete clean and rust removal). At the time of writing, they are still untested.
