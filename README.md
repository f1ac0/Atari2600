# Atari2600
Inside the lot I bought to get my first C64 was also and Atari 2600. It was also listed as "Untested", and it was obviously salvaged from a flood considering the mud and rust that was inside the case. It came without any game or accessory.

While waiting for the system to dry after a complete clean and rust removal I found the useful projects below to help me start with this system I didn't know anything about.
- First I needed some game so I put together a ROM cartridge on a breadboard and created a PCB from it.
- Then not a single TV receiver I had could tune the video and audio signals correctly, but a BT848 PCTV PCI card. The mod by Eddy Foucault worked perfectly, I made my own version with CMS components and 5v only.
- At last I removed the regulator to power the console from a modern 5V power source.

In this repository are the PCBs I created or modified for my own needs.
